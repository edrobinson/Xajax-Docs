# Xajax-Docs
Documentation for the Xajax project

The Xajax project makes adding ajax to a php project a snap but along standing complaint has been the lack of good documentation
although there is a large community of users. This project is an attempt to make Xajax easier to understand and perhaps
attract more users.

Hopefully others will jump in and contribute.
